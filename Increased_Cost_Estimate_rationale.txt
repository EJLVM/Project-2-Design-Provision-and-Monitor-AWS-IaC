To accommodate the new increased budget, I modified the resource configuration of the Amazon EC2 instances for the Web & Application servers, Amazon S3 and, the Database instance (Amazon RDS for MySQL) by increasing their configurations. 

For the EC2 instances, I increased the vCPU & Memory size of the instances, as well as the number of running instances for autoscaling purpose. For the Database instance & Amazon S3; I increased their storage size.
